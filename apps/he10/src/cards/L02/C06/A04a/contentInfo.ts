      `For some time, my grandfather had been busy writing down the village genealogy, known as the whakapapa. The whakapapa had been in his old house. But then came the night of the f ire, which ran through the house and destroyed our past. In only one night, everything we knew was gone. Nani Tama, in despair, went to stay with his daughter, my Auntie Hiraina. Trying to f ind a way out of the ashes of the past, Nani began to write the whakapapa again with his shaky hands. He chanted the names of the ancestors, joining the past to the present once more. The village went quiet and listened to his chanting. His voice traveled along the lines of our genealogy, searching back across the centuries. Sometimes, there were lines that were diff icult to remember. Then his voice suddenly stopped in the middle of the chant. The village waited in worried silence until the next name burst out of his mouth. It took Nani Tama almost two years to gather most of the whakapapa, but there were still missing names he needed to fill in. Now, he wanted me to drive him to Murupara to finish his work.`,
