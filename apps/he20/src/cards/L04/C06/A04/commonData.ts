  content: `  First, let’s explore how this fascinating technology has been applied. The AI-powered neural implant has shown great promise in medical applications, offering solutions to a range of problems. For instance, neural implants are used to treat brain disorders like Parkinson’s disease. These implants electrically stimulate targeted regions of the brain at the right time with the help of AI to restore normal brain activity. In addition, paralyzed people can have the ability to walk again with the help of a “digital bridge” between two implants inserted into their brain and spine. When they think about moving their legs, the AI analyzes the brain signals and sends them to their legs through the implants. Similarly, those who have lost their arms can use artificial arms operated by the same mechanism.`,
